 * @title An ERC-20 token which wraps ETH, potentially with a 1 day lockup period.

 * [WETH9](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2#code).
 * It has the added ability to lockup tokens for 24-25 hours - during this time they may not be
 * transferred or withdrawn, except by our market contract which requested the lockup in the first place.
 * @dev Locked balances are rounded up to the next hour.
 * They are grouped by the expiration time of the lockup into what we refer to as a lockup "bucket".
 * At any time there may be up to 25 buckets but never more than that which prevents loops from exhausting gas limits.
 * FETH is an upgradeable contract. Overtime we will progressively decentralize, potentially giving upgrade permissions
 * to a DOA ownership or removing the permissions entirely.
