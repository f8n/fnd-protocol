# FNDNFTMarket



> A market for NFTs on Foundation.

The Foundation marketplace is a contract which allows traders to buy and sell NFTs. It supports buying and selling via auctions, private sales, buy price, and offers.

*All sales in the Foundation market will pay the creator 10% royalties on secondary sales. This is not specific to NFTs minted on Foundation, it should work for any NFT. If royalty information was not defined when the NFT was originally deployed, it may be added using the [Royalty Registry](https://royaltyregistry.xyz/) which will be respected by our market contract.*

## Methods

### acceptOffer

```solidity
function acceptOffer(address nftContract, uint256 tokenId, address offerFrom, uint256 minAmount) external nonpayable
```

Accept the highest offer for an NFT.

*The offer must not be expired and the NFT owned + approved by the seller or available in the market contract&#39;s escrow.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| nftContract | address | The address of the NFT contract. |
| tokenId | uint256 | The id of the NFT. |
| offerFrom | address | The address of the collector that you wish to sell to. If the current highest offer is not from this user, the transaction will revert. This could happen if a last minute offer was made by another collector, and would require the seller to try accepting again. |
| minAmount | uint256 | The minimum value of the highest offer for it to be accepted. If the value is less than this amount, the transaction will revert. This could happen if the original offer expires and is replaced with a smaller offer. |

### adminCancelOffers

```solidity
function adminCancelOffers(address[] nftContracts, uint256[] tokenIds, string reason) external nonpayable
```

Allows Foundation to cancel offers. This will unlock the funds in the FETH ERC-20 contract for the highest offer and prevent the offer from being accepted.

*This should only be used for extreme cases such as DMCA takedown requests.*

#### Parameters

|---|---|---|
| nftContracts | address[] | The addresses of the NFT contracts to cancel. This must be the same length as `tokenIds`. |
| tokenIds | uint256[] | The ids of the NFTs to cancel. This must be the same length as `nftContracts`. |

### adminCancelReserveAuction

```solidity
function adminCancelReserveAuction(uint256 auctionId, string reason) external nonpayable
```

Allows Foundation to cancel an auction, refunding the bidder and returning the NFT to the seller (if not active buy price set). This should only be used for extreme cases such as DMCA takedown requests.



#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |

```

Buy the NFT at the set buy price. `msg.value` must be &lt;= `maxPrice` and any delta will be taken from the account&#39;s available FETH balance.

*`maxPrice` protects the buyer in case a the price is increased but allows the transaction to continue when the price is reduced (and any surplus funds provided are refunded).*

```

Buy an NFT from a private sale.

*This API is deprecated and will be removed in the future, `buyFromPrivateSaleFor` should be used instead. The seller signs a message approving the sale and then the buyer calls this function with the `msg.value` equal to the agreed upon price. If the seller is no longer the `ownerOf` this NFT or has removed approval for this contract, attempts to purchase from private sale will revert.*

```

Buy an NFT from a private sale.
