# PercentSplitETH



> Auto-forward ETH to a pre-determined list of addresses.

Deploys contracts which auto-forwards any ETH sent to it to a list of recipients considering their percent share of the payment received. ERC-20 tokens are also supported and may be split on demand by calling `splitERC20Tokens`. If another asset type is sent to this contract address such as an NFT, arbitrary calls may be made by one of the split recipients in order to recover them.

*Uses create2 counterfactual addresses so that the destination is known from the terms of the split.*

### proxyCall

```solidity
function proxyCall(address payable target, bytes callData) external nonpayable
```

Allows the split recipients to make an arbitrary contract call.

*This is provided to allow recovering from unexpected scenarios, such as receiving an NFT at this address. It will first attempt a fair split of ERC20 tokens before proceeding. This contract is built to split ETH payments. The ability to attempt to make other calls is here just in case other assets were also sent so that they don&#39;t get locked forever in the contract.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| target | address payable | The address of the contract to call. |
| callData | bytes | The data to send to the `target` contract. |

### splitERC20Tokens

```solidity
function splitERC20Tokens(contract IERC20 erc20Contract) external nonpayable
```

Anyone can call this function to split all available tokens at the provided address between the recipients.

*This contract is built to split ETH payments. The ability to attempt to split ERC20 tokens is here just in case tokens were also sent so that they don&#39;t get locked forever in the contract.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| erc20Contract | contract IERC20 | The address of the ERC20 token contract to split tokens for. |

### splitETH

```solidity
function splitETH() external nonpayable
```

Allows any ETH stored by the contract to be split among recipients.

*Normally ETH is forwarded as it comes in, but a balance in this contract is possible if it was sent before the contract was created or if self destruct was used.*




## Events
