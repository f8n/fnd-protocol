# FETH



> An ERC-20 token which wraps ETH, potentially with a 1 day lockup period.

FETH is an [ERC-20 token](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) modeled after [WETH9](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2#code). It has the added ability to lockup tokens for 24-25 hours - during this time they may not be transferred or withdrawn, except by our market contract which requested the lockup in the first place.

*Locked balances are rounded up to the next hour. They are grouped by the expiration time of the lockup into what we refer to as a lockup &quot;bucket&quot;. At any time there may be up to 25 buckets but never more than that which prevents loops from exhausting gas limits. FETH is an upgradeable contract. Overtime we will progressively decentralize, potentially giving upgrade permissions to a DOA ownership or removing the permissions entirely.*

## Methods

### allowance

```solidity
function allowance(address account, address operator) external view returns (uint256 amount)
```

Returns the amount which a spender is still allowed to transact from the `account`&#39;s balance.



#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| account | address | The owner of the funds. |
| operator | address | The address with approval to spend from the `account`&#39;s balance. |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| amount | uint256 | The number of tokens the `operator` is still allowed to transact with. |

### approve

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external nonpayable returns (bool success)
```

Approves a `spender` as an operator with permissions to transfer from your account.

*To prevent attack vectors, clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to 0 before setting it to another value for the same spender. We will add support for `increaseAllowance` in the future.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| spender | address | The address of the operator account that has approval to spend funds from the `msg.sender`&#39;s account. |
| amount | uint256 | The max number of FETH tokens from `msg.sender`&#39;s account that this spender is allowed to transact with. |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| success | bool | Always true. |

### balanceOf

```solidity
function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256 balance)
```

Returns the balance of an account which is available to transfer or withdraw.

*This will automatically increase as soon as locked tokens reach their expiry date.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| account | address | The account to query the available balance of. |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| balance | uint256 | The available balance of the account. |

### decimals

```solidity
function decimals() external view returns (uint8)
```

The number of decimals the token uses.

*This method can be used to improve usability when displaying token amounts, but all interactions with this contract use whole amounts not considering decimals.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | uint8 | 18 |

### deposit

```solidity
function deposit() external payable
```

Deposit ETH (via `msg.value`) and receive the equivalent amount in FETH tokens. These tokens are not subject to any lockup period.




### depositFor

```solidity
function depositFor(address account) external payable
```

Deposit ETH (via `msg.value`) and credit the `account` provided with the equivalent amount in FETH tokens. These tokens are not subject to any lockup period.

*This may be used by the Foundation market to credit a user&#39;s account with FETH tokens.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| account | address | The account to credit with FETH tokens. |

```

Returns the balance and each outstanding (unexpired) lockup bucket for an account, grouped by expiry.
